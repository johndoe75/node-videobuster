# node-videobuster

Simple NodeJS module for fetching your active and upcoming wanted-list from German video-rental service Videobuster. *This module is still under development and not meant to be used in productive environments*.

## Usage

[Installation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-videobuster)

```bash
npm i node-videobuster
```

Fetch wanted items:

```javascript
var Videobuster= require('../videobuster.js');

var videobuster= new Videobuster({
  username: '{your username goes here}'
  , password: '{your password goes here}'
});

videobuster.login(function(err, res) {
  console.log(err, res);
  videobuster.getActive(function(err, res) {
    console.log(err, res);
    videobuster.getUpcoming(function(err, res) {
      console.log(err, res);
    });
  });
});
```

will return a list like:

```javascript
  [ { status: 'active',
    title: 'Lucy',
    link: '/dvd-bluray-verleih/193221/lucy#bluray' },
  { status: 'upcoming',
    title: 'Plastic',
    link: '/dvd-bluray-verleih/198831/plastic#bluray' },
  { status: 'upcoming',
    title: 'Nightcrawler',
    link: '/dvd-bluray-verleih/189212/nightcrawler#bluray' } ]
```

`active` means the item is on the executed list.  `upcoming` means, the
video/medium is not yet released and will be executed as soon as it's released.

## TODO

* Encoding still broken.  German Umlaute are not correctly displayed.
* Implement a method to fetch Vide-Details.

## FAQ about versioning

Q: Why does this package provide a version 1.x even if it's still Beta?

A: There is no such thing as a zero-version.  Even if it's Beta, even if it's under heavy developmentment,
it is the first version of this package.  That's why I start counting at 1, not at 0.
